#Simple Moodle/Aspire API

Library of simple objects/functions to allow easier access to moodle course/user information, and associated 'Talis Aspire' reading lists from simple, standalone, php rendered pages.

At present this package must be contained within the moodle directory structure so that it can grab the session cookie to check you are logged in etc.

##Usage

Copy the moodle config.php file into the moodlequery directory.

The example php file (example.html.php) collects your user data and enrolled courses from moodle as a demonstration.

Do what you will with your newfound power to list courses and students.
